# Breast_cancer_classification

This is project on classification alogrithms of Machine Learning. It uses a Kaggle data base -Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic) Data Set. The primary aim of the project is to classify whether a cancer is Malignant or Benign . 

We have used multiple alogorithms and arrived at different results. The algorithms used are:-

1- Logistic Regression:- Accuracy- 98.25%
2- Support Vector Machine:- Accuracy-94.74%
3- Decision trees:- Accuracy- 94.74%
4- Random Forest Regression:- Accuracy- 95.61%
5- Knn Regression:- Accuracy- 95.61%
